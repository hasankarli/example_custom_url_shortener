# Flutter Custom URL Shortener

This repository contains the implementation of a custom URL shortener, which serves as an alternative to Firebase Dynamic Links. The idea for this project arose after Firebase announced it would shut down its Firebase Dynamic Links service on August 25, 2025. Since existing services didn't meet my specific needs and integrating a separate service just for app linking felt like overkill, I decided to create my own solution.

You can read more about my journey and the complete implementation in my [Medium article](https://medium.com/@hasankarli/flutter-creating-a-custom-url-shortener-as-an-alternative-to-firebase-dynamic-links-a8a4b5770dae).

## Features

- Custom short URL generation
- Redirection to long URLs
- Integration with Flutter apps for app linking
- Firebase Realtime Database for metadata storage
- Custom logic for handling dynamic link-like behavior
